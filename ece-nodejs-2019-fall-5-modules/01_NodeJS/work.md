# First Node & Git project

Create a basic app with three routes:

- `/` explains how `/hello` works
- `/hello` takes a `name` query parameter and
  - random names replies `hello [name]`
  - your own name replies with a short intro of yourself
  - any other replies a 404 code with a not found message

You should have an `index.js` file with the server creation and `handles.js` defining the server's callback

Add a `package.json` file with you module declaration

Add a `readme.md` file with title, introduction, run instructions and your name

Push it all to a GitLab / GitHub repository and send a link to your repository to sergei@adaltas.com

## Notes

This work is part of the continuous assessment of this class and will be the basis for your final
project. Your final grade will be calculated based on the final project’s result and your Git’s history.
