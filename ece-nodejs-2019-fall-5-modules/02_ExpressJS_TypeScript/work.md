# Part 1: ExpressJS

Using the code and repo from last module, convert everything to use `express` 
instead of doing routing and server setup manually. You should have:
  - `/` home page with description 
  - `/hello` page with the button and AJAX request for obtaining metrics

# Part 2: TypeScript

Using the code and repo from last weeks TP and enhanced in class, 
add to `src/server.ts` the code to expose the front that we had previously
in the `index.js`. You should have:
  - `/` home page with description 
  - `/hello` page with the button and AJAX request for obtaining metrics

# Notes:

This work is part of the continuous assessment of this class and will be the basis for your final project
